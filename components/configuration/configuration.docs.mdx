### Hectare.Platform.Components.Configuration Documentation

## Overview

Purpose of this component is to build a configuration object based on current environment using the
baseline config found in the configuration.json file in the root of the project

You can have your own local overrides of this config, just create a file called configurationlocal.json
also in the root (this will be ignored by git).

The config system can handle encrypted properties and anything sensitive should be encrypted,the properties
will be decrypted when we initialise the config system.

Your local overrides file should look like this where the property name is a path to the config value you
want to replace and the property value is the replacement value

```
{
  "cache.prefix": "nick",
  "database.connection": "postgres://zesttee:admin@postgres:5432/zesttee"
}
```
